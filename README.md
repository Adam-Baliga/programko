Task 

My chosen topic was to create a rudamentary 3D modelling software that uses CSG(constructive solid geometry) to create 3D objects.
CSG is a technique of generating objects by combining prmitive objects/primitives (such as sphere,cuboid, cylinder) using binary operations:  union, intersection, difference.
These 3D models will then be rendered using raycasting.


Programming part

1. Contructive solid geometry
  


2. Raycasting
