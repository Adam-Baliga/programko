# Constructive solid geometry editor

My chosen topic was to create a rudamentary 3D modelling software that uses CSG(constructive solid geometry) to create 3D objects.
CSG is a technique of generating objects by combining primitive objects/primitives (such as sphere,box, cylinder) using binary operations:  union, intersection, difference. These 3D models are then rendered using raymarching. 

## Features

- create, manipulate, combine primitives (Currently: box, sphere, cylinder) to create a scene
- GUI 
- render the scene using raymarching
- save the rendered scene as a bmp
